## My process

### Built with

- HTML and CSS
- Vanilla Javascript
- [SASS/SCSS](https://sass-lang.com) - CSS with superpower
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive Web Design

### What I learned

Instead of changing the text of every timecard, what I have done is just create a new card element and append it inside the container. By doing this, I can simply add a new activity, such as `Sleep`, to the `data.json` file, and it will automatically add a new card inside the html; while I still need to add a new card theme for background color and for the icon, I believe this is easier than modifying the html file everytime Ill add new activity.Â 

I acctually struggle more with CSS than with Javascript but overall this is a fun project and I enjoy it.
